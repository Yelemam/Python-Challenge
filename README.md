# Python-Challenge
# Overview
Welcome to the Python Challenge repository! This project contains two main Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Each directory houses a separate challenge that applies Python scripting to solve real-world problems using data analytics.

# Challenges
**PyBank**
In the PyBank challenge, I'll create a Python script to analyze financial records. Using data from budget_data.csv, the script will compute:

- Total number of months in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the period
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the period, and the average of those changes
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the period
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the period


**PyPoll**
For the PyPoll challenge, you'll help a small town modernize its vote-counting process. Using election_data.csv, the script will determine:

- Total number of votes cast
- Complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes and total number of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on popular vote

# Technologies Used
- Python
- CSV file handling
